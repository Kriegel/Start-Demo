# Start-Demo
The famous Start-Demo script from Jeffrey Snover ; imporved ; to present canned Demos of PowerShell Scripts

- You can specify which file you want to demo (it defaults to “.\demo.txt”)
- You can specify which command to start with (it defaults to 0)
- It shows you the command (both at the prompt and in the Window Title [for the folks at the back of the room) and waits for input. If your input is <CR>, it runs the command.
- You can provide other input and it will do other actions. You can:
- Ask for help using “?”
• Quit at any point
• Dump the list of commands in the demo. It produces a red line above your current point in the demo
• Run another command or Suspend the demo and enter into a nested prompt to explore a topic
• Go to a specified command in the demo
• Find all the commands in the demo using a regular expression
• Check your time. It displays how many minutes and seconds since the start of the demo. This information is also displayed in the Window title on an ongoing basis.
